Just an experiment inspired from http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2014/07/twitter-analytics/ but with different data. The source research was done on Jul 2014.

The new research was done Dec 2016. The result show some trendset changes in the tweets of geekz.

In tweets by languages, In has beaten Fr.

In tweets by Countries, Indonesia and Canada has moved up two places. On the other hand UK is down by 2 places. Brazil is down by large margin (This tweet is collected on a single day, the Brazilian geekz may have overslept on that day!)

In tweets by programming languages, python vs ruby ratio almost doubled, with python just dropping behind Java by some inches! (Earlier python vs ruby ratio was 3.95 and now it is 6.73)
